        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>A person only has two irises – if his pattern is stolen, he quickly runs out of alternatives. Thus methods that protect the true iris pattern need to be adopted in practical biometric applications. In particular, it is desirable to have a system that can generate a new unique pattern if the one being used is lost, or generate different unique patterns for different applications to prevent cross-matching. For backwards compatibility, these patterns should look like plausible irises so they can be handled with the same processing tools. However, they should also non-invertible hide the true biometric so it is never exposed, or even stored. Such "cancelable" biometric techniques that function with standard iris recognition systems, either at the unwrapped picture, were employed in this project.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Cancelable biometrics serves as an effective countermeasure against various template attacks launched by intruders, safeguarding the biometric system. cancelable approach with a novel feature extraction technique for iris recognition, known as the hybrid architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) . To provide cancelability to the system, the project makes use of a random projection technique. The proposed method has the best outcome in terms of accurate identification. The method is validated on two Iris datasets IITD and CASIA, which show promising results on the equal error rate (EER) and accuracy. The proposed model provides 0 EER for IITD and CASIA, respectively, and accuracy 100%, for IITD and CASIA Iris dataset, respectively, which is very high compared to other methodologies. The proposed hybrid architecture is being used for a cancelable biometric system for the first time based on literature review. The efficiency of the proposed method is high when validated on the datasets.</p>

The encoder, on the left, is a typical CNN setup, similar to VGG, featuring two 3×3 convolutional layers, ReLU activation, and max pooling. Each down-sampling step doubles feature channels and halves the image resolution. The decoder, on the right, up-samples feature maps and concatenates them with corresponding encoder outputs. This ensures information flow across scales, preventing loss during down-sampling. The network's final layer is a 1×1 convolution that combines output channels to produce segmentation maps.</p>
